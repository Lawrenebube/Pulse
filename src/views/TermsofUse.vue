                <p>
                    These Terms shall be governed and construed in accordance with the

                    Our failure to enforce any right or provision of these Terms will 
                    not be considered a waiver of those rights. If any provision of 
                    these Terms is held to be invalid or unenforceable by a court, 
                    the remaining provisions of these Terms will remain in effect. 
                    These Terms constitute the entire agreement between us regarding 
                    our Service, and supersede and replace any prior agreements we might 
                    have had between us regarding the Service
